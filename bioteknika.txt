lecture 1 (20.11.2023)

download and learn how to use bioconductor
My SQL : foe accessing and storing data
MongoDB : cloud computing of big data
web development : HTML, CSS, Javascript
Data visualization : Matplotlib (in python), ggplot2(in R) to create high quality graph plots

lecture 3: (22.11.2023)
python is a scripting language
jupyter is command line editor

packages are inbuilt pipelines available. eg NumPy (numerical data analysis using python)
matplotlib (for visualization)

lecture 5 (23.11.2023)

w3school : tutorial for numpy and matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt means call matplotlib as plt

open numpy and matplotlib using w3school and try and use all the python tutorials in jupyter (open jupyter using anaconda). Make sure u import numpy and matplotlib. this import means #include i.e including the libraries. All of this u have to do in jupyter lab


seaborn is a statistical data visualisation library for python which can be used in matplotlib
type pip install (name of library), search and then copy the pip install (name of library) and paste in jupyter lab

go to seaborn and then three lines on top left and select gallery to get all the types of graph. 
'import seaborn as sns' to include the library in jup lab.

hue = legends
pallete = to assign colours eg: palette=["m", "g"]

try copy and pasting code for heatmap in jup lab.
search breast cancer data visualization using python in google and go for kaggle website. U can also find this on github

df.shape = give me the total count of my data (400, 16) 16 means coloumns
df.describe() = analyses the data
df.info = gives information on the data whether it has int char etc.

kaggle is a good website to get data for plotting graphs. 

#To import the Iris dataset:
iris = pd.read_csv("../input/Iris.csv") # the iris dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame

#To view Iris data below:
iris.head()

instead of ../input/Iris.csv u have to download the data set and then copy the path file from properties and paste it there. then execute the program. for eg

df = pd.read_csv("C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\Anaconda files\breast cancer.csv")
df.head()

#this will give an error cause python treats \ as a char in the above address. by default the addresses of files have \. to solve this either add one more \ to all \, or replace all \ with /, or just add r before the " like 
 
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\Anaconda files\breast cancer.csv")
then u can run without any errors
df = data frame
df.head(10)( 10 means display only 10 coloumns of the downloaded data whose path is included in the program.)
df.shape means it will give u how many (roes,columns) are there in ur data
df.describe (describes the data)
df.info (gives information about the data)

in kaggle when u copy and use different functions like
iris.plot(kind="scatter", x="SepalLengthCm", y="SepalWidthCm")
plt.show()

in above, according to your data, replace x and y terms above with the coloumns of the data. Also make sure that if u want to plot graph of the data that u have, select the coloumns that have numbers and not characters or strings and paste it in x and y in the function that is copied.

to get data visualization using matplotlib, u can write plt.default(x, y) if u dont know which type of graph to choose. Or else u can use plt.pychart(x, y), plt.scatter(x, y) etc


Day 6: sequence allignment

plotly python library will help u present data in an animated manner. it makes interactive graphs
install plotly library by typing pip install on google, copy and paste in notebook
in plotly, go to basic charts and see how different plots have been made by programming

in the plotly site in the example graph just above the graph on cursor stimulation u can see different tools to see the graph

for the plot of sepal and petal in plotly, do the following:
search iris csv on google, u will get github link, in that u wil get the data for sepal and petal length of 3 species. our aim is to find out which species has better length. Click on download zip. Save it in an independent folder cause u need the path (u can also perform ML on this)
in plotly on LHS there is a blsck section where u can see different example graphs. 
to plot a 3D graph, use import plotly.graph_objects as go (already there in example sets)

check this video out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9UrKTVEeZA

if u are planning to work on big data, u can use google colab. it is free. learn to use google colab. 

Day 7: GC content

visit biopython website, explore and learn.
in PROSITE protein motif information is stored
>>>import bio 
this is a partent package under which there are child packages. To call the child package called Seq, we write
>>>from Bio.Seq import Seq 

learn how to integrate biopython compiler in VS

from Bio.Alphabet import generic_protein 
this means whatever the seq u have written, convert it to protein seq
rec.format("fasta")
this will conert protein sequence to fasta format

the best link to learn more about biopython is tutorialspoint biopython

xplore expasy which is a database like NCBI
try biopython in google colab

Day 8: Transcription and Translation

on google colab, try and use the codes from the tutorialspoint for biopython
add = concatenation

the statements from Bio.Seq import yyyy are very important. It can give u errors if u dont import the required child package from the parent package 

to clear all the basics of biopython, check this link out
https://github.com/enesbasbug/Bioinformatics-with-Biopython/blob/master/Bioinformatics_with_Biopython.ipynb


steps to upload the entire program from github to colab:
1. go to github and search for the program u want to upload on colab
1. In google colab, click file, click open notebook, after opening u will see the github section
3. copy paste the github link in colab

https://github.com/biopython/biopython 
this is the github link for learning the biopython programs

the problem with google colab is that whenever u open a new notebook, u need to pip install the files again

check this out
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Bioinformatics-with-Python-Cookbook-Second-Edition/blob/master/Datasets.ipynb

https://github.com/enesbasbug/Bioinformatics-App-with-Streamlit

!pip install py3Dmol
this is to produce 3D models 

DAY 9: MOTIF SEARCH IN SEQUENCES

learn to use PDB
to create drugs models in computer, use
!pip install RDKit
which is a package for chemoinformatics and ML

simplified molecular input line entry system = smiles

DAY 10: CALCULATING MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF PROTEINS

if u run dir(Bio) in google colab after !pip install Biopython, you will get all the packages availabe in Biopython

to load a fasta file:
seq_file_read = SeqIO.read('sequence.fasta', 'fasta')
seq_file_read

instead of sequence.fasta u put the fasta file
check the following commands out:

#type
type(seq_file_read)

#list of sequence details
seq_file_read .id

#get sequence
seqfromfile = seq_file_read.seq
seqfromfile
 
#list sequence details
for record in SeqIO.parse('sequence.fasta', 'fasta'):
print(record)

#store seq for later analysis
seqfromfile = record.seq
seqfromfile

#length of sequence
len(seqfromfile)

R bioconductor is an open source for bioinformatics for sequence analysis, functional analysis, interaction networks, systems biology analysis
CADD, omics approach etc
learn R from w3schools and github
R has been downloaded in the pc. In R in top section in packages there are different packages available. You can click and install them
also you can update the packages manually

first you have to install R then you can install Rstudio
downolad R from cran 
download Rstudio from posit

R studio is like an IDE just like VS code. to install packages in R, click tools and click install packages. in the second box, type the
name of the package u want to install. so it will install from cran and put it in R studio

in R studio
ctrl + shift + n = new file
# means comment

in top right there is tutorials section for any tutorials for R
in bottom right section in packages if you type your package name in the search box, and click on the package, you will get all the information regarding that package 

DAY 12: amino acid composition analysis
all the content is in the R file.
